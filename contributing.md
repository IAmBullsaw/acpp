# Contributing
## The process is as follows:

1. Open an issue to discuss what you want to add or simply ask a question
2. Open a new branch named according to name rules.
3. Given a go for the change, go ahead. Do your thing :).
4. Open up a pull request and refer to it in the issue, asking us to review it.
5. If it is up to our standards, we will accept it and merge.

## Standards
* Only written in english
* Only things relevant to C++ should be added
* Code must compile
* Compiler and flags to the supplied code must be supplied

## Branch naming rules
* If you add information in /exams/README.md you should name your branch: exam-YYYYMMDD

If this branch already exists, use it.

Other rules are not currently set, so Wild West approach is given.

## As always
* Be nice
* Be proper
* Use child friendly language
